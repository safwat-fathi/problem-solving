// * Given a set o unique characters s, k is an array that contains a set of valid and invalid words.
// * A word is valid if it was only generated from the set of the characters in s.
// * Return the number of valid words. If no valid words are found, return 0.

// * Example:
// * Input: s = "cb", k = ["cd", "bd", "cccb", "bcc", "bcdcb"]
// * Output: 2
// * Explanation: Strings "cccb" and "bcc" are valid since they only contain characters 'c' and 'b'
